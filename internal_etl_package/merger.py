"""Maria's stateful merger.

Reverts the target table to a prior healthy snapshot before applying the new
source files, so a backfill for an older date can't trample newer writes.
Mechanics: ledger lookup → engine rollback → engine merge → ledger record.

Notice: this module does not import any specific compute engine. It speaks
through the TableEngine abstraction only, which is why swapping Spark for
Trino later is a one-file change in engines/.
